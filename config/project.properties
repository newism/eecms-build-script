# project.properties file defines overrides for default.properties

# Explanation: This file should be created by each user as and when he or she needs to override particular values.
# Consequently, it should not be placed under version control.


# Stylesheets
#
# Note: Stylesheets will be concatenated in the order they are listed in the file.stylesheets property (i.e. the last
# file listed will be at the end of the concatenated file), so it probably makes sense to have the main style.css file
# as the first entry
# Example:
# file.stylesheets  = style.css, lightbox.css, plugin.css
#
file.stylesheets  =


# Web Pages
#
# These are the pages (files) that will be served to users (.html, .php, .asp, etc). Files in this property will
# be minified / optimised and have any stylesheet or javascript references updated to the minified examples
#
# The paths need to be relative
#
# Files can be added in a comma separated form
file.pages        =



# Excluded files and dirs
#
# Add any files or directories you add to the project and do not want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files are ignored in addition to the default ones specified in default.properties.

# Specify an environment to build
#
# By Default, it builds a production environment
# Set to dev if buidling a development environment
# Set to test if building a test environment

#
# Bypass Optimization for these image files or folders
#
# images.bypass   =
# If set, these images will not be optimized
# Note: you cannot declare an empty images.bypass property, it would exclude the entire img folder from being optimized

#
# Image Optimisation
#
images.strip.metadata       = true
# Seting this to true will strip the metadata from all jpeg files.
# YOU SHOULD ONLY DO THIS IF YOU OWN THE COPYRIGHT TO ALL THE IMAGES IN THE BUILD
